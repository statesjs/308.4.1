//after looking into the split() method, I don't know why I was over-complicating it. I was probably sleep deprived
//but fresh eyes and fresh brain made this problem 10x easier when I recognized to just use the length() method to get a count
//and dynamically console.log the entire array at each index position.

let rows = csv.split("\n"); //splitting into 5 different rows

for (let i = 0; i < rows.length; i++) {
  console.log(rows[i]);
}
//just a cleaner way to console.log without needed to know how many indexes exist beforehand
// especially when the data is too long
//the previous code doesnt look that messy, but look at the commits and you'll see just how bad it got. My god I
//don't know how I got so off track

//I had alot of difficulty trying to understand hwo to dynamically make
// rowsSplit have the array containing smaller arrays but then I realized the 2 problems:

//PROBLEM 1 : you can't create initialize a variable dynamically with rowsSplit[i] = etc

//PROBLEM 2 : rowsSplit = rowsTest[i].split(",") (<---LINE 29) assigns and overwrites the previous array,
//making the value just take on the last array in the iteration (<---SEE LINE 32)

//Tory was great at explaining how to reference sub arrays (<---LINE 35)

//CONCLUSION: using the push method off every iteration into a new variable will FINALLY acheive a subarray
//that can be reference by using their main index then their sub index ex. rowsSingleValues[num]num]

//there are errors setting each row into seperate variable without hardcoding,
// but this was also just sounded cleaner anyways

      rowsSingleValues[i].push("");
